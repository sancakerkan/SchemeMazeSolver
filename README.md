## Introduction

**Scheme Path Solver** is a Scheme-based utility designed to navigate paths in a grid layout. The program calculates the sequence of movements needed to travel from a starting point to a finish point in a grid where black cells represent walls and white cells are navigable. The starting point is always at `[0,0]`, and the finish point is denoted by the letter 'F'.

## Features

- **Grid Dimensions:** Retrieve the gridâ€™s height and width using `getHeight` and `getWidth` functions.
- **Cell Content:** Access the letter at any grid position with the `getLetter` function.
- **Path Solution:** Solve the path with the `solvePath` function, which returns a sequence of movements.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Racket Scheme interpreter. Download it from [here](https://download.racket-lang.org/).

### Cloning the Repository

1. **Using Git:**
    - Clone the repository using the following command:
      ```bash
      git clone https://github.com/sancakerkan/SchemePathSolver
      ```
    - Navigate to the project directory:
      ```bash
      cd SchemePathSolver 
      ```

2. **Alternatively, Download ZIP:**
    - [Download ZIP](https://github.com/sancakerkan/SchemePathSolver/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)

## Usage

### Running the Program

1. **Using Racket:**
    - Open the Racket IDE.
    - Set the language to "The Racket Language".
    - Open the file `src/PathSolver.rkt`.
    - Run the program.

## How It Works

The program provides a solution as a sequence of movements such as "D D R R R R D D". This sequence indicates movements down 2 times, right 4 times, and down 2 more times. The grid layout ensures that there is only one solution with a single possible move for each step.
